	<h1>Change Cipher Spec message</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>The change cipher spec protocol exists to signal transitions in
			ciphering strategies. The protocol consists of a single message,
			which is encrypted and compressed under the current (not the pending)
			connection state. The message consists of a single byte of value
			1.[...]</p>
		<p>The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent by both the client and the
			server to notify the receiving party that subsequent records will be
			protected under the newly negotiated CipherSpec and keys. Reception
			of this message causes the receiver to instruct the record layer to
			immediately copy the read pending state into the read current state.
			Immediately after sending this message, the sender MUST instruct the
			record layer to make the write pending state the write active state.</p>
