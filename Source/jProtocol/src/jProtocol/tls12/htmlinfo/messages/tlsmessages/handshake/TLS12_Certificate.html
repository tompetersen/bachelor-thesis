	<h1>Server certificate message</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>The server MUST send a Certificate message whenever the agreed-
			upon key exchange method uses certificates for authentication (this
			includes all key exchange methods defined in this document except
			DH_anon). This message will always immediately follow the ServerHello
			message.</p>
		<p>The certificate list is a sequence (chain) of certificates. The
			sender’s certificate MUST come first in the list. Each following
			certificate MUST directly certify the one preceding it. Because
			certificate validation requires that root keys be distributed
			independently, the self-signed certificate that specifies the root
			certificate authority MAY be omitted from the chain, under the
			assumption that the remote end must already possess it in order to
			validate it in any case.</p>
