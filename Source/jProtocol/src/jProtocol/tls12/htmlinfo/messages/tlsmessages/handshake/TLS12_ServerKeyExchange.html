	<h1>Server key exchange message</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>
			This message will be sent immediately after the server Certificate
			message (or the ServerHello message, if this is an anonymous
			negotiation). The ServerKeyExchange message is sent by the server
			only when the server Certificate message (if sent) does not contain
			enough data to allow the client to exchange a premaster secret. This
			is true for the following key exchange methods:<br /> DHE_DSS<br />
			DHE_RSA<br /> DH_anon
		</p>
		<p>This message conveys cryptographic information to allow the
			client to communicate the premaster secret: a Diffie-Hellman public
			key with which the client can complete a key exchange (with the
			result being the premaster secret) or a public key for some other
			algorithm.</p>
