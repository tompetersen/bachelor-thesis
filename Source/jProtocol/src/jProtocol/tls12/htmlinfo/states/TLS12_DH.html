	<h1>Diffie-Hellman</h1>
	<p>The Diffie-Hellman-algorithm is a way to exchange a key securely
		through an unsecure channel.</p>
	<p>
		The two parties which want to communicate agree on a multiplicative
		group modulo the prime p and a generator g of this group. Party A
		chooses a random value X_a and computes Y_a = g^(X_a) mod p.<br />
		The same does party B: Y_b = g^(X_b) mod p. Y_a and Y_b are the public
		keys of A and B and are sent to the other party.
	</p>
	<p>Now A can compute the exchanged key as K = Y_b^X_a mod p. B gets
		the same key by computing K = Y_a^X_b mod p. An adversary not knowing
		X_a or X_b has no simple possibility to compute K.
