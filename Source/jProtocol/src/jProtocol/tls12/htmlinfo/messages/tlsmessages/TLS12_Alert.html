	<h1>Alert message</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>One of the content types supported by the TLS record layer is
			the alert type. Alert messages convey the severity of the message
			(warning or fatal) and a description of the alert. Alert messages
			with a level of fatal result in the immediate termination of the
			connection. In this case, other connections corresponding to the
			session may continue, but the session identifier MUST be invalidated,
			preventing the failed session from being used to establish new
			connections. Like other messages, alert messages are encrypted and
			compressed, as specified by the current connection state.</p>
