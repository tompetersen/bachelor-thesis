			<b>finished_label</b>: For Finished messages sent by the client, the

			<b>handshake_messages</b>: All of the data from all messages in this
			handshake (not including any HelloRequest messages) up to, but not
			including, this message. This is only data visible at the handshake
			layer and does not include record layer headers. This is the
			concatenation of all the Handshake structures as defined in Section
			7.4, exchanged thus far.
