		<p> A TLS connection state is the operating environment of the TLS Record
   Protocol. It specifies a compression algorithm, an encryption
   algorithm, and a MAC algorithm. In addition, the parameters for
   these algorithms are known: the MAC key and the bulk encryption keys
   for the connection in both the read and the write directions. [...] <br />
    The security parameters for the pending states can be set by the TLS
   Handshake Protocol, and the ChangeCipherSpec can selectively make
   either of the pending states current</p>
