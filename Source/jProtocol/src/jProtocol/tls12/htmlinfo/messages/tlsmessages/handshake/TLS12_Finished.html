	<h1>Finished message</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p> A Finished message is always sent immediately after a change
      cipher spec message to verify that the key exchange and
      authentication processes were successful.  It is essential that a
      change cipher spec message be received between the other handshake
      messages and the Finished message.</p>
		
		<p> The Finished message is the first one protected with the just
      negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets.  Recipients of Finished
      messages MUST verify that the contents are correct.  Once a side
      has sent its Finished message and received and validated the
      Finished message from its peer, it may begin to send and receive
      application data over the connection.</p>
