	<h1>Cipher suite list</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>The cipher suite list, passed from the client to the server in
			the ClientHello message, contains the combinations of cryptographic
			algorithms supported by the client in order of the client’s
			preference (favorite choice first). Each cipher suite defines a key
			exchange algorithm, a bulk encryption algorithm (including secret key
			length), a MAC algorithm, and a PRF. The server will select a cipher
			suite or, if no acceptable choices are presented, return a handshake
			failure alert and close the connection. If the list contains cipher
			suites the server does not recognize, support, or wish to use, the
			server MUST ignore those cipher suites, and process the remaining
			ones as usual.</p>
