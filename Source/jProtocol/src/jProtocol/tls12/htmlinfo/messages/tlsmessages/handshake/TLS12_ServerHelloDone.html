	<div class="citation">
		<p>The ServerHelloDone message is sent by the server to indicate
			the end of the ServerHello and associated messages. After sending
			this message, the server will wait for a client response.</p>
		<p>This message means that the server is done sending messages to
			support the key exchange, and the client can proceed with its phase
			of the key exchange.</p>
		<p>Upon receipt of the ServerHelloDone message, the client SHOULD
			verify that the server provided a valid certificate, if required, and
			check that the server hello parameters are acceptable.</p>
