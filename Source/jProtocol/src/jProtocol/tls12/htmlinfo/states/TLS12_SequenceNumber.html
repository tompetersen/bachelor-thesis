	<h1>Sequence number</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>Each connection state contains a sequence number, which is
			maintained separately for read and write states. [...] A sequence
			number is incremented after each record: specifically, the first
			record transmitted under a particular connection state MUST use
			sequence number 0.</p>

	<p>The sequence number is used as a part of the integrity
		protection of a message. It is contained in the MAC computation or the
		additional data of AEAD ciphers.</p>
