	<h1>Pseudorandom function (PRF)</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p> In addition, a construction is required to do expansion of secrets
   into blocks of data for the purposes of key generation or validation.
   This pseudorandom function (PRF) takes as input a secret, a seed, and
   an identifying label and produces an output of arbitrary length.</p>
   <p> First, we define a data expansion function, P_hash(secret, data),
   that uses a single hash function to expand a secret and seed into an
   arbitrary quantity of output:</p>
		<pre>
P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +
                       HMAC_hash(secret, A(2) + seed) +
                       HMAC_hash(secret, A(3) + seed) + ...
with
     A(0) = seed
     A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))</pre>
		<p> where + indicates concatenation. P_hash can be iterated as many times as necessary to produce the
   required quantity of data. [...] TLS's PRF is created by applying P_hash to the secret as:</p>
		<pre>
PRF(secret, label, seed) = P_hash(secret, label + seed)
</pre>
