	<div class="citation">
		<p>The cryptographic parameters of the session state are produced
			by the TLS Handshake Protocol, which operates on top of the TLS
			record layer. When a TLS client and server first start communicating,
			they agree on a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms,
			optionally authenticate each other, and use public-key encryption
			techniques to generate shared secrets.</p>
		<p>The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange
				random values, and check for session resumption.</li>
			<li>Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the
				client and server to agree on a premaster secret.</li>
			<li>Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow
				the client and server to authenticate themselves.</li>
			<li>Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and
				exchanged random values.</li>
			<li>Provide security parameters to the record layer.</li>
			<li>Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has
				calculated the same security parameters and that the handshake
				occurred without tampering by an attacker.</li>
		</ul>
