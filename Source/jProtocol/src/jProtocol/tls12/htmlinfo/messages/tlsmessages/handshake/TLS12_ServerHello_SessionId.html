	<h1>Session ID</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>This is the identity of the session corresponding to this
			connection. If the ClientHello.session_id was non-empty, the server
			will look in its session cache for a match. If a match is found and
			the server is willing to establish the new connection using the
			specified session state, the server will respond with the same value
			as was supplied by the client. This indicates a resumed session and
			dictates that the parties must proceed directly to the Finished
			messages. Otherwise, this field will contain a different value
			identifying the new session. The server may return an empty
			session_id to indicate that the session will not be cached and
			therefore cannot be resumed. If a session is resumed, it must be
			resumed using the same cipher suite it was originally negotiated
			with. Note that there is no requirement that the server resume any
			session even if it had formerly provided a session_id. Clients MUST
			be prepared to do a full negotiation -- including negotiating new
			cipher suites -- during any handshake.</p>
