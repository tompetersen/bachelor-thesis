	<h1>Compression method list</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>This is a list of the compression methods supported by the
			client, sorted by client preference. If the session_id field is not
			empty (implying a session resumption request), it MUST include the
			compression_method from that session. This vector MUST contain, and
			all implementations MUST support, CompressionMethod.null. Thus, a
			client and server will always be able to agree on a compression
			method.</p>
