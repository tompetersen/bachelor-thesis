		<p> A TLS connection state is the operating environment of the TLS Record
   Protocol. It specifies a compression algorithm, an encryption
   algorithm, and a MAC algorithm. In addition, the parameters for
   these algorithms are known: the MAC key and the bulk encryption keys
   for the connection in both the read and the write directions. [...] <br />
   All records are processed under the current read and write states.</p>
