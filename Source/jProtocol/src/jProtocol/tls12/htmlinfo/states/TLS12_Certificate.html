	<div class="citation">
		<p>As part of the X.509 protocol (a.k.a. ISO Authentication
      framework), certificates are assigned by a trusted Certificate
      Authority and provide a strong binding between a party’s identity
      or some other attributes and its public key.</p>

	<p>In real application certificates have a more complicated format than the one used in this software. 
	Such a certificate could look like this:</p>
