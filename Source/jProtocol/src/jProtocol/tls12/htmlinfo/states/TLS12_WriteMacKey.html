	<h1>Write MAC key</h1>
	<p>Client write MAC key and server write MAC key are used for
		computing the message authentication code in stream and block ciphers.
		Their size is cipher suite dependent.</p>
	<p>They are computed like this:</p>
	<div class="citation">
		<p>The master secret is expanded into a sequence of secure bytes,
			which is then split to a client write MAC key, a server write MAC
			key, a client write encryption key, and a server write encryption
			key. Each of these is generated from the byte sequence in that order.
			Unused values are empty. Some AEAD ciphers may additionally require a
			client write IV and a server write IV. [...]</p>
		<p>To generate the key material, compute</p>
		<pre>
key_block = PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret,
                "key expansion",
                SecurityParameters.server_random +
                SecurityParameters.client_random);</pre>
		<p>until enough output has been generated. Then, the key_block is
			partitioned as follows:</p>
		<pre>
client_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
server_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
client_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
server_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
client_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
server_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]</pre>

	<h1>Pseudorandom function (PRF)</h1>
	<div class="citation">
		<p> In addition, a construction is required to do expansion of secrets
   into blocks of data for the purposes of key generation or validation.
   This pseudorandom function (PRF) takes as input a secret, a seed, and
   an identifying label and produces an output of arbitrary length.</p>
   <p> First, we define a data expansion function, P_hash(secret, data),
   that uses a single hash function to expand a secret and seed into an
   arbitrary quantity of output:</p>
		<pre>
P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +
                       HMAC_hash(secret, A(2) + seed) +
                       HMAC_hash(secret, A(3) + seed) + ...
with
     A(0) = seed
     A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))</pre>
		<p> where + indicates concatenation. P_hash can be iterated as many times as necessary to produce the
   required quantity of data. [...] TLS's PRF is created by applying P_hash to the secret as:</p>
		<pre>
PRF(secret, label, seed) = P_hash(secret, label + seed)
</pre>
