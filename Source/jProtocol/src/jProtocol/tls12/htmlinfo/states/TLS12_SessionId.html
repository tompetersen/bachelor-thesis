		<h1>SessionId</h1>
		<div class="citation">
		<p>The ClientHello message includes a variable-length session
	   identifier. If not empty, the value identifies a session between the
	   same client and server whose security parameters the client wishes to
	   reuse. The session identifier MAY be from an earlier connection, 
	   this connection, or from another currently active connection. The
	   second option is useful if the client only wishes to update the
	   random structures and derived values of a connection, and the third
	   option makes it possible to establish several independent secure
	   connections without repeating the full handshake protocol. These
	   independent connections may occur sequentially or simultaneously; a
	   SessionID becomes valid when the handshake negotiating it completes
	   with the exchange of Finished messages and persists until it is
	   removed due to aging or because a fatal error was encountered on a
	   connection associated with the session. The actual contents of the
	   SessionID are defined by the server.</p>
